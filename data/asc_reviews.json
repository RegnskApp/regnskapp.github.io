      "title": "Great simple net worth tracker",
      "review": "I am really happy with this app. I use it to track net worth across a variety of accounts. I love that I can separate out shared accounts, I put  kids college savings in that bucket since I don’t consider it mine. Great simple functionality to transfer between accounts, update balances, use as much custom labeling as you want. My only feedback to developers would be to improve the y axis on the graphs. The lower bound is always pegged at zero, which means an account has to have a very small balance for any trend to really be reflected in the graph. Hypothetically, if I have $1million saved (I don’t, lol), and I contribute $1000 this month to the account, the graph doesn’t even register the change because the y axis scale is so compressed. If that y axis auto adjusted to the relevant range, or gave an option to adjust the scale, I would appreciate that— it would mean I could see the lines moving in the right direction. Otherwise no complaints, I appreciate this app and use it a bunch!",

      "review": "This app deserves no less than 5 stars because of what it offers in such a price. All the required features to track daily expenses are there. Integration with Apple Pay through shortcuts is a clear winner.\nSupport is also very good. Highly recommended.",

      "title": "Ottime potenzialità",
      "review": "L’app consente di tenere traccia delle entrate e delle uscite in modo semplice: puoi registrare quando ricevi denaro (entrata) o quando lo spendi (uscita). Criticità: Quando imposti un saldo iniziale del conto (es: 10.000 €) e poi inserisci spese passate, il saldo scende come previsto — sarebbe utili avere una voce  “transazione neutra”: scegliendo questo tipo, la voce viene registrata per la storia ma non modifica il saldo del conto.",
